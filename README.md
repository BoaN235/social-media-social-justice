# Social Justice Social Media
**bold text** Social Justice Social Media is a platform to spread awarness on the injustices in our world
This website is a platform for individuals to raise awarness in your community regarding social injustices
You can sign in as an Advisor or as a Supporter. As an Advisor, you can post about any social injustices anywhere in the world. As a Supporter, you can focus on helping a cause you want to boost
This project is mainly targeted towards the more niche causes because if something is left unnoticed, then it can become a way bigger issue. This doesn't mean the more noticed injustices aren't as important.
